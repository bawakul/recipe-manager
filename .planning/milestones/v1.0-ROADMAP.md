# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-30
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 8 (7 formal + 1 ad-hoc deployment)

## Overview

Voice-to-checklist tool for improvised cooking. Ramble about what you're making, get a structured checklist. Built for TRMNL hackathon, shipped for personal use.

## Deployed

| Component | URL |
|-----------|-----|
| Web App | https://recipe-displayer.vercel.app |
| API | https://recipe-parser.bawas-lab.workers.dev |
| GitHub | https://github.com/bawakul/recipe-manager |

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: API accepts rambling voice transcripts and returns structured recipe JSON
**Dependencies**: None
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Set up Cloudflare Worker with Claude API for transcript parsing

### Phase 2: Web Interface

**Goal**: Users can view recipes as interactive checklists and track progress
**Dependencies**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Project setup with Next.js, Tailwind, types, and API client
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Input page with auto-grow textarea and loading state
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Recipe checklist with progress tracking and localStorage
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Complete flow integration with adjust panel

### Phase 3: TRMNL Integration

**Goal**: Recipes can be pushed to TRMNL e-ink display via webhook
**Dependencies**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Add TRMNL webhook endpoint with payload formatting and auto-push

### Phase 4: iOS Shortcut

**Goal**: Users can go from voice recording to displayed recipe in one seamless flow
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans (partially completed, shipped via ad-hoc deployment)

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Add URL query param recipe loading to frontend
- [~] 04-02-PLAN.md — iOS Shortcut build guide (documented, not formally verified)

Note: Phase 4 was partially executed. URL param support shipped. iOS Shortcut guide created but end-to-end flow not formally tested. Project deployed and working via manual TRMNL setup + web UI.

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- iOS Shortcut for transcription (leverage iOS built-in)
- LocalStorage over database (hackathon simplicity)
- Cloudflare Workers for API (edge, fast cold starts)
- TRMNL steps as plain strings (template uses `{{ step }}` not `{{ step.text }}`)
- Fire-and-forget TRMNL push (parse always succeeds, TRMNL is secondary)

**Issues Resolved:**
- TRMNL webhook 404 (URL copy/paste issue)
- TRMNL template not showing steps (step.text vs step)
- Vercel deployment env var not picked up (hard refresh needed)

**Technical Debt:**
- iOS Shortcut not formally tested end-to-end
- TRMNL template is functional but basic (could be prettier)
